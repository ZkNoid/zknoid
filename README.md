### Implementing your own game
ZkNoid is a modular platform that makes it easy to implement you own game using platform infrastructure. 
To build a game you need to create a game folder inside [apps/web/games](https://github.com/ZkNoid/zknoid/tree/develop/apps/web/games).
Define game config and implement front-end and contracts part in [packages/chain/src/](https://github.com/ZkNoid/zknoid/blob/develop/packages/chain/src/)
